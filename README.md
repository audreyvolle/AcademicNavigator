Authors: Misael Escoto, Darin McBride, Audrey Volle, Ziwen Xu

Academic Navigator is a program which can help a user create a course plan for their given degree program. The program allows the user to select a core path, around which they can fill in the rest of their schedule through one of two different visualization options. A created schedule can be saved for future revisions or exported as a printable file for convenience when meeting with a class advisor.
